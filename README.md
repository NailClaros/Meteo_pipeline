# üå¶ NC Weather Data Dashboard

An **end-to-end Data Engineering + Backend Engineering** project that ingests live weather data, stores it in the cloud, and visualizes it with **interactive charts**.

Built by **Nail Claros**, a Computer Science graduate from UNC Charlotte, as a way to **learn, practice, and showcase** real-world backend and data engineering skills.

## üìå Features

- **Real-time Weather Data** ‚Äì Hourly weather metrics for Charlotte, Raleigh, and Greensboro.
- **Historical View** ‚Äì Switch between cities and metrics to see the **last 7 days** of data.
- **Interactive Charts** ‚Äì Hover for detailed tooltips, compare metrics, and explore without page reloads.
- **Custom Cooldown Logic** ‚Äì Prevents excessive database queries using Redis-backed rate limiting.
- **Daily Caching** ‚Äì Automatically caches results for the day to reduce redundant calls.
- **Fully Cloud-Integrated** ‚Äì Uses Neon PostgreSQL for persistent storage and AWS for intermediate file storage.
- **Backend-Focused Architecture** ‚Äì Demonstrates API integration, caching, and scalable querying patterns.

## üõ† Architecture Overview

This app isn‚Äôt just charts ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **full pipeline**:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Pulls raw weather data from an **external weather API**.
   - Targets multiple cities with hourly granularity.
   - Fetches core metrics:  
     - üå° Temperature  
     - ‚òÅ Cloud Cover %  
     - üå¨ Wind Speed  
     - (Expandable for more)

2. **Transformation**
   - Normalizes timestamps into **UTC**.
   - Renames and formats metrics into a **long-form** structure for better plotting flexibility.
   - Adds human-readable labels (`12AM`, `3PM`, etc.).

3. **Cloud Storage**
   - Intermediate files sent to **AWS**.
   - Persistent storage in **PostgreSQL hosted via Neon** for:
     - Fast analytical queries
     - Rolling window historical views

4. **Caching & Rate Limiting**
   - **Streamlit `@st.cache_data`**  
     - Stores results for **the current day**, avoiding duplicate fetches when possible.
   - **Redis Cooldown System**  
     - Enforces a **minimum refresh interval** (e.g., 30 seconds) to protect the database.
     - Stores the true session refresh state in Redis.
     - _Note:_ Due to Streamlit's session limitations, cooldown persistence is fully enforced server-side, but the countdown timer may reset visually when the app refreshes.

5. **Visualization**
   - Uses **Altair** for responsive, interactive visualizations.
   - Features:
     - Multiple line charts
     - Per-hour hover summaries
     - Independent y-axis scaling per metric
     - Legend placement for clarity
   - Separate views:
     - **Three small panels** for real-time metrics
     - **One large panel** for weekly historical data

## üß† Advanced Concepts Used

### 1. **Long-Form Data for Visualization**
Most charting libraries prefer a **long** structure:

### 2. **Transformation**
- Timestamps are normalized and broken into user-friendly labels (e.g., `1PM`, `12AM`).  
- Raw data is restructured into **long-form** (time, metric, value) which enables flexible charting:
  ```text
  time             | metric               | value
  2025-08-04 01:00 | Temperature (¬∞F)     | 85.2
  2025-08-04 01:00 | Wind Speed @80m (mph)| 5.6
  ```text
  
This makes it easier to:
- Switch metrics dynamically
- Apply color scales per metric
- Group by time for comprehensive hover tooltips

3. Cloud Storage & Persistence
- Processed data is sent to AWS for staging (as part of the pipeline infrastructure).
- Ultimately persisted in a Neon-hosted PostgreSQL database, enabling performant time-windowed analytical queries (e.g., last 7 days, today's date-based querying).

4. Caching & Rate Control
-Streamlit Cache (@st.cache_data):
-Caches ‚Äútoday‚Äù and weekly data per day to avoid unnecessary database hits during normal use.

Redis Cooldown System:

- Tracks per-client, per-location refresh eligibility server-side.
- Prevents refresh spamming even if users reload or try to cheat the frontend.
- Maintains authoritative cooldown; the UI reflects it but is decoupled from Streamlit session volatility.
- Note: Because Streamlit's session state can reset on browser refresh, the visual countdown might refresh too, but Redis still enforces the true cooldown behind the scenes.

5. Visualization
Built with Altair, offering:
- Layered charts (lines + hover-highlighted points + rule)
- Independent y-axis scaling (for mixed-unit metrics)Clean legend placement
- Dynamic selection of cities and metrics
- Combined summaries on hover (all metric values at a given time)
